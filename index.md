**Salute librarians, public libraries and teachers.**
The public library is a place where almost everyone has free access to both the site and its content of knowledge, entertainment and social activities. Here we can rest, warm up or visit a toilet. Libraries are bastions of knowledge. Here we can educate ourself. It is one of society’s most important sites. The public library is based on the idea of a joint ownership, where we borrow and return. Here we can meet, study, play chess, listen to recitals and get information on books we have not read. It is a place filled with people who are experts in connecting information and data.

Use the public library as a classroom and artistic place!
We are curious and passionate monsters, reliable, empathetically dangerous, love(-ly), mad and playful creatures in both a material, sensual (sense) and comic world.
This education placed in the library leads us into a nuanced, multi-layered and diverse world in which no one is forced to choose sides between concrete, abstract, fictional and real.
We float like amorphous creatures in different directions and to various destinations. 
Why should we educate ourselves in elementary schools, high schools, colleges, University's or other institutions and rule-governed places? 
Is it because we must always be ready to satisfy someone else’s needs? 
Do we educate ourselves out of fear for the future, otherwise we will not get a job, no income?
Can we change, and search for an education out of curiosity and wonder, a search for what we do not yet know, but feel that we need?

To teach is to perform, but what kind of performance is it? Is the place I use for the educational purpose a stage or a playground were I can act out different approaches to relational situations of learning and teaching? 
An important mission for Chronicle:Quest is to approach teaching (education/art) as performance and as an performative activity. In this digital space you will find fragments of, and ideas on, what teaching and pedagogy can be, and become, when approached from an artistic perspective. What kind of plays, games or rituals can teaching transform into when mixed and merged with (contemporary)art? Dissolution of disciplines is in many ways a logical consequence of how contemporary and institutionalized art and art education have developed. We are all trained in contexts where participation and cooperation are common components. But can a performative understanding of education, within the different artistic fields, create a new meta‐art‐form, a form of a teaching/performance/art?  
Chronicle:Quest turn teaching and pedagogy inside out and try out what happens when life become learning, and learning become performance.
