Homoglyphi.cc is a tool for contemporary Unicode calligraphy. The user can combine characters from all scripts of the code structure to create alternative word-images and text art. Two symbols are said to be homoglyphs if they are visually similar enough to be exchangeable. The Unicode Standard is a utopian masterplan where each archetypical symbol is given its own space in an immense skeletal structure reaching for the sky. “Unicode covers all the characters for all the writing systems of the world, modern and ancient.” At the time of writing, 110,182 symbols are encoded. Many of these are (if you use your imagination) homoglyphs. This offers possibilities for creative users wishing to ornament their written words and express themselves within the boundaries of typographically restrictive social media.
The Standard defines a true essence beyond the stylesheet. Milleniums of human cilvilization snapped to a flat grid. This universal, ultimate standard is the codebook of global text-communication. On a material level this world of symbols depends on fonts, files installed on the local machines, to become visible. If the required font is missing the reader sees a crossed out box, a question mark or nothing.
